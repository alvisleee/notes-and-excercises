* Exercise 1.1.1: What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?

		A compiler is a program that can read in one language and translate it to another language(target language),
		A interpreter is a program that can run the source language.

* Exercise 1.1.2 What is the advantages of (a) a compiler over an interpreter (b) an interpreter over a compiler?

		a) The machine-language target program produced by a compiler can run faster than an interpreter
		b) An interpreter can usually give better error diagnostics than a compiler

* Exercise 1.1.3 What advantages are there to a language-processing system in
which the compiler produces assembly language rather than machine language?
